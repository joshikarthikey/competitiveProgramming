# Competitive Programming

Welcome to my Competitive Programming repository! This is a personal initiative to document my growth as I strengthen my fundamentals in Computer Science and sharpen my problem-solving skills through structured learning and rigorous practice.

## Learning Roadmap

I am following a structured path inspired by MITâ€™s foundational Computer Science courses and complementing it with hands-on practice using the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/).

### Core Courses

| Course       | Focus Area                                               |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **6.100L**   | Introduction to Computer Science and Python Programming   |
| **6.042J**   | Mathematics for Computer Science (Discrete Math, Logic)   |
| **6.006**    | Introduction to Algorithms and Complexity Analysis        |

Each course has its own folder with:
- Lecture notes and summaries  
- Code implementations (in Python or C++)  
- Exercises and assignments

## Practice: CSES Problem Set

To apply theoretical concepts and build speed and accuracy, I am solving problems from the **CSES Problem Set**. Solutions will be implemented in either **Python** or **C++**, based on suitability and performance.
